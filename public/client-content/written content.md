Over the years I have gained a wealth of knowledge and understanding of the human body and how beneficial regular Pilates practice can be for all. I hope for years to come, that I will continue my own professional development and share my expertise with many.

### What is Pilates?

Joseph Pilates (founder) choreographed a low impact body-conditioning exercise method that works by targeting and isolating the deep postural (core) muscles. With emphasis on slow controlled breathing and movement to rebalance the body and improve posture which promotes subconscious correct alignment. Pilates achieves the perfect balance between strength and flexibility and is a great way to help relieve unwanted stress and tension.

### Why Pilates?

## Studio Pilates Details

### 1-2-1 Studio Pilates

Our Free Rein home studio is a luxurious and calming space to allow clients the opportunity to escape reality for an hour of 'me time'. We offer private reformer and small equipment sessions choreographed to support every clients personal goals.

### Why Reformer?

Reformer Pilates is a dynamic form of exercise performed on a machine - the 'reformer'. Unlike traditional mat-based Pilates, the reformer adds resistance through a system of springs and pulleys, allowing for controlled, low-impact movements that strengthen and lengthen muscles.

One of the main reasons the reformer has become such a popular piece of equipment in our studio is its adaptability - It can be modified to suit anyone, from beginners to advanced athletes, and is particularly effective in rehabilitation and injury prevention.

### The key benefits of reformer Pilates

Reformer Pilates has been proven to help people improve strength, flexibility, and mobility, all while being gentle on the joints. Some key benefits include:

- **Stronger core and better posture** - Many injuries stem from a weak core or poor postural habits. Reformer Pilates helps strengthen the deep abdominal and back muscles, creating a solid foundation for pain-free movement.

- **Enhanced flexibility and mobility** - Unlike static stretching, the reformer encourages active stretching while strengthening muscles, promoting healthy joint movement and flexibility.

- **Reduced pain and injury risk** - Whether it's back pain, joint stiffness, or a sports injury, Pilates-based rehabilitation helps correct imbalances and supports long-term recovery.

### What can reformer Pilates help with?

Reformer Pilates is effective for a wide range of conditions, including:

- **Back pain and postural issues** - Strengthens deep core muscles, reducing spinal strain.
- **Knee and hip injuries** - Provides low-impact strength training to stabilise joints.
- **Sports injuries** - Supports rehabilitation while maintaining overall fitness.

## Equestrian Pilates Details

### Equestrian Pilates Sessions

Our Equestrian Pilates sessions have been carefully planned and developed to create a deeper seat and partnership with horse and rider.

Imbalances can develop over time, based on physiology, posture and lifestyle. How you move or stand when not riding (for example, with rounded shoulders.) Can directly affect how you function in the saddle.

Pilates exercises help to increase your body awareness and improve flexibility, balance and strength in order for a rider to facilitate an optimal riding position.

Whether you wish to improve your range of motion, flexibility, posture or general fitness, our Pilates sessions will help you to achieve your goals. The sessions are planned to work on strengthening and stabilising core muscle groups allowing you as a rider to achieve a neutral, shock absorbing spine and pelvis, which will in turn develop a trusting riding relationship where your horse responds to your commands and is confident in your leading ability.

Get in touch with me to let me know your needs and I can create an individual training plan for you from there.
